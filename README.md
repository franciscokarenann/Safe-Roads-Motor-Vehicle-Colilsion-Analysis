Safe Roads Motor Vehicle Collision Analysis

SAS Canada, Geotab Inc., and Toronto Police Services collaborated to host the Safe Roads Competition for university and college students worldwide. Participants utilized SAS Studio to develop skills in data manipulation and geospatial analysis and presented solutions to enhance Toronto's road safety to a panel of executive judges after six weeks.


Introduction
Toronto, Ontario is Canada’s largest city and the fourth most populous city in North America. In a
2022 report , Toronto was similarly ranked first in Canada and fourth in North America for traffic
congestion. Road safety is a clear area of concern, and the purpose of this competition is to provide
insights and recommendations to address some of the challenges posed to the City of Toronto.

Problem Statement
For this competition, suppose that you are a recent data scientist hire in the Analytics & Innovation
unit at Toronto Police Services and are handed your first project. The project will focus on a new
dataset comprising all Motor Vehicle Collision (MVC) occurrences over the last decade – from
January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2023 – and the Traffic Services leadership team is looking for
input and recommendations from you and your colleagues.

Using SAS, you’ve been tasked with exploring and analyzing the data, generating insights and
recommendations, and preparing a presentation to the leadership team. These recommendations
should primarily aim at improving road safety for all citizens, reducing traffic fatalities and injuries,
and align where relevant with the City of Toronto’s Vision Zero
