Safe Roads Motor Vehicle Collision Analysis

SAS Canada, Geotab Inc., and Toronto Police Services collaborated to host the Safe Roads Competition for university and college students worldwide. Participants utilized SAS Studio to develop skills in data manipulation and geospatial analysis and presented solutions to enhance Toronto's road safety to a panel of executive judges after six weeks.

2024 Safe Roads Competition

Introduction
Toronto, Ontario is Canada’s largest city and the fourth most populous city in North America. In a
2022 report 1, Toronto was similarly ranked first in Canada and fourth in North America for traffic
congestion. Road safety is a clear area of concern, and the purpose of this competition is to provide
insights and recommendations to address some of the challenges posed to the City of Toronto.

Problem Statement
For this competition, suppose that you are a recent data scientist hire in the Analytics & Innovation
unit at Toronto Police Services and are handed your first project. The project will focus on a new
dataset comprising all Motor Vehicle Collision (MVC) occurrences over the last decade – from
January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2023 – and the Traffic Services leadership team is looking for
input and recommendations from you and your colleagues.
Using SAS, you’ve been tasked with exploring and analyzing the data, generating insights and
recommendations, and preparing a presentation to the leadership team. These recommendations
should primarily aim at improving road safety for all citizens, reducing traffic fatalities and injuries,
and align where relevant with the City of Toronto’s Vision Zero Plan2. They may also include
suggestions for further study or data collection.
Some of the questions you may examine include:
• What patterns do you observe? What effects – time of day, weather, location – are
meaningful? What strategies might you recommend that address these factors?
• Are there relationships between locations with high numbers of incidents? Are these
relationships predictive? If so, to what extent? Can this information be used in proactive
prevention initiatives?
• Is there evidence that incidents or patterns have changed over time? If so, how? Are you
able to suggest why?
• Are there “sensitive” areas (e.g., near schools, hospitals, or other public buildings) that are
particularly risky? How are they affected by serious accidents?


Outcomes from this competition can potentially help municipalities with initiatives related to
pedestrian and traffic safety or be a compelling case at the provincial level in advocating for policy
change. Consider how you might address any of the following:
• Examining public safety data through new, creative lenses
• Traffic-calming and/or pedestrian safety initiatives
• Vision Zero safety measures and collaboration
• Service gaps
• Next steps in leveraging IOT datasets to gain more robust insights

Primary Data Source I: Toronto Police Services
The Toronto Police Service (TPS) is the first municipal police service created in North America and
among one of the oldest in the English-speaking world. It is also one of the leaders in data analytics
with their Analytics and Innovation Unit which supports operational and strategic initiatives at TPS.
They also maintain an open data portal (http://data.torontopolice.on.ca/) which is intended to
improve transparency and confidence, as well as public safety in Toronto.
One key strategic area for TPS is traffic safety as it relates to public awareness and enforcement.
Recent data on traffic collisions resulting in serious injuries or death have been released publicly by
the Toronto Police Service in partnership with the City of Toronto Transportation Safety Unit, with
the goal of collaborating broadly on approaches to traffic safety and to use data and analytics to
drive decisions.
• Toronto Police Services – Motor Vehicle Collision (MVC): All collisions by date and
geographic location, spanning January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2023.
• Toronto Police Services – Killed or Seriously Injured Dataset: includes traffic collision
events in the City of Toronto where a person was either Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) from
2006 – 2022.
Links to these datasets and instructions on how to upload and use within SAS Viya for Learners will
be provided during the competition kickoff.

Primary Data Source II: City of Toronto
Traffic safety around schools, hospitals, places of worship, parks and other buildings with heavy
public usage are of particular concern. To help you identify these areas, two data sets maintained
by the City of Toronto are available:
● City of Toronto One Address Repository: The authoritative address database which
includes exact geographical locations of each city address, as well as the name of the
location (e.g., church, school, park, etc.) if available.
● City of Toronto Centreline Intersection Dataset: All intersections in the city of Toronto.

Secondary Research
Because part of your solution should focus on actionable insight, you might want to consider

leveraging your academic resources to seek out articles, case studies, or other scholarly, peer-
reviewed publications with a similar focus on road safety. Exploring some of the work already being
done may help in motivating or focusing your own research. Examples might include:
• Research on driver/pedestrian/cyclist behavioural trends
• Industry vehicle safety reports
• Case studies highlighting other police services elsewhere in Canada or globally
